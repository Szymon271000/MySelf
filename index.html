        <h1>THE STAGES OF MY LIFE</h1>
        <p>I think that everybody should travel in his own life.</p> <p>I have been lucky, I had the possibility to grew up in three different countries.</p> 
        <p>I could know different cultures, people, traditions, ways of doing.</p> 
        <p>That' s why I am grateful for this opportunity.</p>

            <h1>Bari</h1>
            <p>What should I say? Well, it is a special city for me. 
                This is the city where I spent the most of my life (15 years). 
                I have so many memories. The first friendships, the childhood, the nights on the beach and many others. 
                I think that this part of world is special. There are two expressions could describe this part of world. 
                The first one is: When a stranger comes to the South he cries twice: when he arrives and when he leaves. 
                The second is:I do not envy Heaven to God because I am happy to live in South Italy.

            <h1>Frankfurt</h1>
            <p>When I got there it was shock. I was 15 years old. It was a completely new world comparing to South Italy. I had to go to a new school, know new people, have new challenges. 
                I spent there three years. It was not easy. I learnt many things, new people. In spite of everything I think it was a period where I could understand how the things work in the world.

            <h1>Krakow</h1>
            <p>I am grateful to this city. I could finish the high school, know new people (my girlfriend as well :)), get my first job.
                I have a good memory about the high school. 
                I forged some friendships that are really special to me. 
                Many of these friends live now abroad or away from Krakow but this does not stop us from meeting.
                I remember anxiety before the first job interview.
